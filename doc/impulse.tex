The rows of $S_k$ are channel response functions and the columns
impulse response functions.

As noted, the columns of $S_k$ are impulse response functions.  
We can represent an impulse at $v_j$, the frequency at position $j$
of the input grid, as $p_j=1$, $p_{i\ne j}=0$, and then $S_k p$ is
simply column $j$ of $S_k$.  The distinction of channel vs impulse
response is important in comparing AIRS with instruments such as
CrIS, where ``response function'' typically means impulse response.
