airs2cris -- an quick overview of the AIRS to CrIS translation

decon -- a more detailed writeup of the AIRS deconvolution and IASI
to CrIS, IASI to AIRS, AIRS to CrIS, and CrIS to AIRS translations,

finterp.pdf -- the basics of interferometric interpolation.


Although most relevant material should now be in the decon writeup,
and they are not generally available, the asl blog posts give a good
overview of how these ideas were developed.  These are listed in
chronological order, with the second group probably the most useful.
