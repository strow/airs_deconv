source/airs2cris.m is the main procedure for translating AIRS to
CrIS radiances, see the matlab-style help at the start of the file
for more info.

test/kc2cris.m convolves kcarta to CrIS channel radiances.  It is
used here to test the translation but has more general applications.

doc/airs2cris/airs2cris.pdf gives a short introduction to AIRS
deconvolution, AIRS to CrIS translation, and validation of that
translation.

doc/decon/airs_decon.pdf has the start of a more detailed writeup,
but for now is not much more than some definitions and notes.

The following ASL blog posts include an overview and the results of
simulation studies, done with code from the test subdirectory
