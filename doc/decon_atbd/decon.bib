abstract = "We present a new technique for the fast computation of
                  near-monochromatic atmospheric transmittances in
                  the infrared, utilizing compressed look-up tables,
                  that is well suited for nadir viewing satellite
                  and airplane observations. The algorithm is very
                  simple to use in radiative transfer codes and is
                  easily adapted to provide analytic Jacobians of
                  radiances. A Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is
                  used to transform very large monochromatic look-up
                  tables of optical depths into a compressed
                  representation that is approximately 73 times
                  smaller. Temperature and pressure interpolations
                  are performed in the compressed representation,
                  resulting in significant savings in computation
                  times. The resulting transmittances are as
                  accurate as those computed with a line-by-line
                  algorithm. "
