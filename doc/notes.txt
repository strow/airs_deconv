note we will need 1c, rtp interface, conventions for things like
beam position, the derived midpoint, fill for gaps, etc

the true cris minus airs cris residual is very stable for varying
intermediate dv from 0.23 down to 0.05 (the finest I checked), and
seems to work fine as long as dv < min airs step.  There are a few
points around 700 1/cm where the residual difference is 0.1 to 0.2K
but the rms difference 10 1/cm inside the user grid is only about
0.01K.

The deconvoluted radiances look smoother and may have more fine
structure with the finer dv, but they can also have significant
overshoot vs the 0.23 grid
