airs_decon v 1.3
-----------------

H. Motteler, 10 Oct 2015

Overview
---------

airs_decon is a matlab package to deconvolve AIRS channel radiances,
taking advantage of detailed knowledge of the AIRS spectral response
functions.  Applications include reconvolving with the CrIS response
function to translate AIRS to CrIS radiances.  This package includes
support routines such as kc2cris and mksconv1 which take kcarta high
resolution to CrIS and AIRS channel radiances

airs2cris.m is the main function for AIRS to CrIS translations.
test/demo1.m gives an example of calling it.  The translation has
been tested extensively with both real and simulated AIRS 1c data.

A function cris2airs.m for CrIS to AIRS translation is included, 
but does not work as well as the AIRS to CrIS translation in the 
LW because the CrIS resolution is too low

Documentation includes man-page style comments for most procedures,
with fundamentals and validation in doc/decon/decon.pdf.

Top Level Directories
----------------------

  doc      - documentation
  source   - user source directory
  test     - test source directory
  h4tools  - basic HDF SD tools

User Paths
-----------
  
Application running in the test directory set the following paths

  ../source
  ../h4tools
  /asl/packages/ccast/source

Paths are set in the calling routines, the demo and test routines
here.  ccast provides bandpass, finterp, inst_params, rad2bt and
bt2rad.  h4tools provides h4sdread which is used by mksconv1 and
mksconv2.  ccast is available at https://github.com/strow/ccast.git

User Functions
---------------

  airs_decon  - deconvolve AIRS radiances
  airs2cris   - translate AIRS to CrIS radiances
  cris2airs   - translate CrIS to AIRS radiances
  mksconv1    - create a general-purpose sparse AIRS SRF matrix
  mksconv2    - create a modified SRF matrix for deconvolutions
  seq_match   - find the matching subsequence of two sequences
  trim_chans  - drop close neighbors from an AIRS channel set
  kc2cris     - convolve kcarta to CrIS channel radiances

  mkhamm      - sparse hamming convolution matrix 
  hamm_app    - spectral space forward hamming 
  hamm_inv    - spectral space inverse hamming

The hamming functions are called as an option in airs2cris, and may
be useful for other applications.

Validation
-----------

The function test/cris_test5.m has the most recent AIRS to CrIS
validation tests.  Similar tests for the CrIS to AIRS translation
are in test/airs_test1.m
