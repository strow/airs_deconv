airs_decon v 0.9, beta release
-------------------------------

H. Motteler, 12 Sep 2013


Overview
---------

This is a "beta" release.  It works well with simulated AIRS 1c
data but hasn't been tested with real 1c data.  The user interface
is source/airs2cris.m, see the help there for more info.

There is more code in the test than the source directory--testing
and validation are key parts of the package.

Documentation is sparse--this file, test/README, and comments in
many of the individual procedures, but not much else.  There is the
start of a latex write-up, just an intro for now, in airs_decon/doc.


Top Level Directories
----------------------

  doc      - documentation
  source   - user source directory
  test     - test source directory


User Paths
-----------
  
  /asl/matlib/h4tools
  /asl/packages/ccast/source
  /asl/packages/airs_decon/source

The ccast path provides bandpass.m, finterp.m, inst_params.m, and
also rad2bt.m and bt2rad.m.  The functions mkhamm.m and seq_match.m
in airs_decon/source are copied from ccast/motmsc/utils.  

If things are set up right users should not need the airs_decon/test
path.


User Functions
---------------

  airs2cris   - translate AIRS to CrIS radiances
  airs_decon  - deconvolve AIRS radiances
  mksconv2    - build a sparse AIRS convolution matrix
  seq_match   - find the matching subsequence of two sequences
  trim_chans  - drop close neighbors from an AIRS channel set

  mkhamm      - sparse hamming convolution matrix 
  hamm_app    - spectral space forward hamming 
  hamm_inv    - spectral space inverse hamming

The hamming functions are not called by any other functions in
source, but may be useful for some user applications.
