Overview
---------

airs_decon is a Matlab git repo to translate channel radiances
from AIRS to CrIS, from AIRS to an idealized grating model, and
from CrIS to AIRS.  Translations from AIRS use a deconvolution of
AIRS channel radiances, taking advantage of detailed knowledge of
the AIRS spectral response functions.

airs2cris.m is the main function for AIRS to CrIS translations.
test/demo1.m gives an example of calling it.  The translation has
been tested extensively with both real and simulated AIRS 1c data.

The package includes functions to convolve high resolution kcarta
radiances (at a 0.0025 cm-1 grid) to AIRS and CrIS channel radiance,
and simple functions for forward and inverse hamming apodization.

Documentation includes man-page style comments at the top of most
most functions.  doc/decon_atbd.pdf gives an overview and comparison
of the IASI to CrIS, IASI to AIRS, AIRS to CrIS, and CrIS to AIRS
translations.  doc/decon_paper.pdf give a detailed analysis of AIRS
deconvolution and the AIRS to CrIS translation.

Application running in the test directory set the following paths

  ../source

Paths are set in the calling routines, the demo and test routines
here.  ccast provides bandpass, finterp, inst_params, rad2bt and
bt2rad.  ccast is available at https://github.com/strow/ccast.git

User Functions
---------------

  airs_decon  - deconvolve AIRS radiances
  airs2cris   - translate AIRS to CrIS radiances
  cris2airs   - translate CrIS to AIRS radiances
  mksconv1    - create a general-purpose sparse AIRS SRF matrix
  mksconv2    - create a modified SRF matrix for deconvolutions
  seq_match   - find the matching subsequence of two sequences
  kc2cris     - convolve kcarta to CrIS channel radiances

  mkhamm      - sparse hamming convolution matrix 
  hamm_app    - spectral space forward hamming 
  hamm_inv    - spectral space inverse hamming

The hamming functions are called as an option in airs2cris, and may
be useful for other applications.

Validation
-----------

The function test/cris_test5.m has the most recent AIRS to CrIS
validation tests.  Similar tests for the CrIS to AIRS translation
are in test/airs_test1.m
