airs_decon v 1.2
-----------------

H. Motteler, 15 Sep 2015

Overview
---------

airs_decon is a matlab package to deconvolve AIRS channel radiances,
taking advantage of detailed knowledge of the AIRS spectral response
functions.  Applications include reconvolving with the CrIS response
function to translate AIRS to CrIS radiances.  This package includes
support routines such as kc2cris and mksconv1 which take kcarta high
resolution to CrIS and AIRS channel radiances

The function for AIRS to CrIS translation is source/airs2cris.m.  
This includes matlab-style help.  The script test/demo1.m gives an
example of calling it.  The translation has been tested extensively
with both real and simulated AIRS 1c data.

A function cris2airs for CrIS to AIRS translation is included, but
works poorly in the LW because the CrIS resolution is too low

Documentation includes this file, test/README, the first draft of 
a writeup in the doc directory, comments in many of the procedures,
and several recent blog reports, listed in doc/notes.txt.

User Paths
-----------
  
  /asl/matlib/h4tools
  /asl/packages/ccast/source
  /asl/packages/airs_decon/source

The ccast path provides bandpass.m, finterp.m, inst_params.m, and
also rad2bt.m and bt2rad.m.  The functions mkhamm.m and seq_match.m
in airs_decon/source are copied from ccast/motmsc/utils.  


User Functions
---------------

  airs_decon  - deconvolve AIRS radiances
  airs2cris   - translate AIRS to CrIS radiances
  cris2airs   - translate CrIS to AIRS radiances
  mksconv1    - create a general-purpose sparse AIRS SRF matrix
  mksconv2    - create a modified SRF matrix for deconvolutions
  seq_match   - find the matching subsequence of two sequences
  trim_chans  - drop close neighbors from an AIRS channel set

  mkhamm      - sparse hamming convolution matrix 
  hamm_app    - spectral space forward hamming 
  hamm_inv    - spectral space inverse hamming

The hamming functions are called as an option in airs2cris, and may
be useful for other applications.


Validation
-----------

The function test/cris_test5.m has the most recent AIRS to CrIS
validation tests.  Similar tests for the CrIS to AIRS translation
are in test/airs_test1.m
