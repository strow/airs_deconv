airs_decon v 1.05
------------------

H. Motteler, 15 Jan 2014


Overview
---------

airs_decon is a matlab package to deconvolve AIRS channel radiances,
taking advantage of a detailed representation of the AIRS spectral
response functions (SRFs).  A typical application is to reconvolve
the result with the response functions for another instrument, for
example to translate AIRS to CrIS radiances.  

The function for AIRS to CrIS translation is source/airs2cris.m.
This has matlab-style help, and the script test/demo1.m gives an
example of using it.  The translation has been tested extensively
with both real and simulated AIRS 1c data.

Documentation includes this file, test/README, the first draft of 
a writeup in the doc directory, comments in many of the procedures,
and several recent blog reports, listed in doc/notes.txt.

User Paths
-----------
  
  /asl/matlib/h4tools
  /asl/packages/ccast/source
  /asl/packages/airs_decon/source

The ccast path provides bandpass.m, finterp.m, inst_params.m, and
also rad2bt.m and bt2rad.m.  The functions mkhamm.m and seq_match.m
in airs_decon/source are copied from ccast/motmsc/utils.  


User Functions
---------------

  airs2cris   - translate AIRS to CrIS radiances
  airs_decon  - deconvolve AIRS radiances
  mksconv2    - build a sparse AIRS convolution matrix
  seq_match   - find the matching subsequence of two sequences
  trim_chans  - drop close neighbors from an AIRS channel set

  mkhamm      - sparse hamming convolution matrix 
  hamm_app    - spectral space forward hamming 
  hamm_inv    - spectral space inverse hamming

The hamming functions are called as an option in airs2cris, and may
be useful for other applications.
