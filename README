airs_decon v 0.95, beta release
--------------------------------

H. Motteler, 8 Jan 2014


Overview
---------

This is a "beta" release.  It works well with simulated AIRS 1c 
data and in initial tests with real 1c data.  The top-level user
interface for AIRS to CrIS translation is source/airs2cris.m; 
see the matlab-style help there and the example calling script
test/demo1.m for more info.

The main processing steps are (1) build the convolution matrix for 
a particular AIRS SRF set, (2) invert this or take a pseudo-inverse,
(3) use the inverse to translate AIRS channel radiances to an
intermediate form, and (4) interpolate or convolve the intermediate
form to a final representation.  The final form for tests so far is
either CrIS or AIRS radiances with a different SRF set.

Documentation includes this file, test/README, the first draft of a
writeup in the doc directory, and comments in many of the individual
procedures, and several recent blog reports, listed in doc/notes.txt.


Top Level Directories
----------------------

  doc      - documentation
  source   - user source directory
  test     - test source directory


User Paths
-----------
  
  /asl/matlib/h4tools
  /asl/packages/ccast/source
  /asl/packages/airs_decon/source

The ccast path provides bandpass.m, finterp.m, inst_params.m, and
also rad2bt.m and bt2rad.m.  The functions mkhamm.m and seq_match.m
in airs_decon/source are copied from ccast/motmsc/utils.  

If things are set up right users should not need the airs_decon/test
path.


User Functions
---------------

  airs2cris   - translate AIRS to CrIS radiances
  airs_decon  - deconvolve AIRS radiances
  mksconv2    - build a sparse AIRS convolution matrix
  seq_match   - find the matching subsequence of two sequences
  trim_chans  - drop close neighbors from an AIRS channel set

  mkhamm      - sparse hamming convolution matrix 
  hamm_app    - spectral space forward hamming 
  hamm_inv    - spectral space inverse hamming

The hamming functions are not called by any other functions in
source, but may be useful for some user applications.
