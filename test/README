demo1 - AIRS to CrIS translation demo
demo2 - CrIS to AIRS translation demo


AIRS to CrIS tests
-------------------

a2cris_test1 - compare AIRS CrIS with true CrIS
a2cris_plot1 - combined residual plots from a2cris_test1
a2cris_loop  - call airs2cris in chunks, for large files

a2cris_stat1 - AIRS to CrIS stats for big cloudy and clear sets
a2cris_stat2 - AIRS to CrIS stats on Tsurf - Tb900cm-1 subsets
a2cris_stat3 - AIRS to CrIS stats ozone vs residuals
a2cris_stat4 - AIRS to CrIS regression tests

cris_test5 - processes all the fitting profiles and plots the means
    of residuals.  Derived frim cris_test4, drops the interpolation
    tests and adds some stats.  This is the current test script.

cris_test4 - processes all the fitting profiles and plots the means
    of residuals.  Derived frim cris_test3, calls airs2cris instead
    of airs_decon and adds an option for hamming apodization of the
    test radiances.

cris_test7 - compare deconvolved AIRS with 0.2 cm-1 sinc ILS
cris_test6 - AIRS to CrIS translation benchmark


AIRS-specific tests
--------------------
CrIS to AIRS and AIRS channel shift tests, see the README there


Functions and Support
----------------------

srf_read - read an hdf4 format SRF file

mkaconv -- build a sparse AIRS convolution matrix from channel indices 
           and an explicit input frequency grid, typicaly a channel set

mksconv -- build a sparse AIRS convolution matrix from channel indices 
           and a spacing parameter for the input grid.

plot_chans1 - find a lower bound for AIRS 1b channel step size
plot_chans2 - show channels step sizes before and after trimming
