AIRS-specific tests
--------------------
airs_test has CrIS to AIRS and AIRS channel shift tests, see the
README there for more info

moved to zold
--------------
a2cris_stat1 - AIRS to CrIS stats for big cloudy and clear sets
a2cris_stat2 - AIRS to CrIS stats on Tsurf - Tb900cm-1 subsets
a2cris_stat3 - AIRS to CrIS stats ozone vs residuals

cris_test4 - processes all the fitting profiles and plots the means
    of residuals.  Derived frim cris_test3, calls airs2cris instead
    of airs_decon and adds an option for hamming apodization of the
    test radiances.

cris_test5 - processes all the fitting profiles and plots the means
    of residuals.  Derived frim cris_test4, drops the interpolation
    tests and adds some stats.  This is the current test script.

cris_test7 - compare deconvolved AIRS with 0.2 cm-1 sinc ILS
cris_test6 - AIRS to CrIS translation benchmark

band_regr - banded regression, solve R * B = C for banded R

mkaconv - build a sparse AIRS convolution matrix from channel indices 
          and an explicit input frequency grid, typicaly a channel set
