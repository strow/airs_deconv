a2cris_regr1 - AIRS to CrIS Tb regression corrrection, dependent
   and independents sets of roughly equal size are chosen at random
   from the 7377 profile cloudy set

a2cris_regr2 - AIRS to CrIS Tb regression corrrection, dependent
   set 7377 profile cloudy, independent set 49 fitting profiles

   dependent and independents sets of roughly equal size are chosen
   at random from the 7377 profile cloudy set

a2cris_regr4 - AIRS L1c to CrIS direct regression test and plots,
   uses data from conv_loop4

   and plots, derived from a2cris_regr, uses data from conv_loop4

a2cris_test1 - compare AIRS CrIS with true CrIS, derived from
   a2cris_stat1 and cris_test5, uses convolved data from conv_loop
   and a2cris_loop

a2cris_test2 - compare AIRS CrIS with true CrIS; 3-band summary
   plots of the airs2cris statistical correction, uses convolved
   data from conv_loop1 and a2cris_loop

L1d_test1  - basic test of L1d_conv
L1d_test2  - try deconvolution to the L1d SRF set
L1d_test3  - compare L1c to L1d de/recon vs regression
L1d_regr1  - regression corrrection for L1c to L1d decon/recon
L1d_bbody  - AIRS L1c to L1d with bbody correction

a2cris_loop - call airs2cris in chunks, for large files

plot_SRF2  - plot sample AIRS SRFs with gauss fit and channel spacing

functions
----------

sup_gauss  - higher order gaussian
mkBconv    - build a sparse gaussian convolution matrix
L1d_conv   - build a sparse AIRS L1d convolution matrix
band_regr  - banded regression, solve R * B = C for banded R
trim_chans - drop close neighbors from an AIRS channel set
 
more AIRS to CrIS 
------------------

a2cris_stat1 - AIRS to CrIS stats for big cloudy and clear sets
a2cris_stat2 - AIRS to CrIS stats on Tsurf - Tb900cm-1 subsets
a2cris_stat3 - AIRS to CrIS stats ozone vs residuals

cris_test5 - processes all the fitting profiles and plots the means
    of residuals.  Derived frim cris_test4, drops the interpolation
    tests and adds some stats.  This is the current test script.

cris_test4 - processes all the fitting profiles and plots the means
    of residuals.  Derived frim cris_test3, calls airs2cris instead
    of airs_decon and adds an option for hamming apodization of the
    test radiances.

cris_test7 - compare deconvolved AIRS with 0.2 cm-1 sinc ILS
cris_test6 - AIRS to CrIS translation benchmark

AIRS-specific tests
--------------------
CrIS to AIRS and AIRS channel shift tests, see the README there

Functions and Support
----------------------

srf_read - read an hdf4 format SRF file

mkaconv -- build a sparse AIRS convolution matrix from channel indices 
           and an explicit input frequency grid, typicaly a channel set

mksconv -- build a sparse AIRS convolution matrix from channel indices 
           and a spacing parameter for the input grid.

plot_chans1 - find a lower bound for AIRS 1b channel step size
plot_chans2 - show channels step sizes before and after trimming
